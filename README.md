# Web Finite Automata

A web-based application that converts regular expressions into equivalent NFA and DFA. 

## TODO:

- [x] Implement a simple parser for regular expressions through combinators.
- [x] Implement conversion of NFA to DFA.
- [x] Implement the minimization of DFA through Hopcroft's algorithm.
- [ ] Beautify the website.
- [ ] Add details
  - [ ] State List
  - [ ] Transition Table
