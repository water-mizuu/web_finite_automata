# Web Finite Automata

A web-based application that converts regular expressions into equivalent NFA and DFA.

## TODO:

- [x] Implement a simple parser for regular expressions through combinators.
- [x] Implement conversion of NFA to DFA.
- [x] Implement the minimization of DFA through Hopcroft's algorithm.
- [x] Simple input recognition.
- [ ] Simulation of input recognition.
  - [ ] Simple implementation
  - [ ] Rewrite using discriminated unions.
- [ ] Beautify the website.
- [ ] Add details
  - [ ] State List
  - [ ] Transition Table

## ONGOING:

- [ ] Rewrite using discriminated unions
  - [x] NFA
  - [ ] DFA
